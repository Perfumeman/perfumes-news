It was originally known as the "whiskey cocktail" and consisted of whiskey, sugar, water, and bitters. The drink’s name "Old Fashioned" emerged during the late 1800s when bartenders began experimenting with new and more complex cocktails, and some patrons requested their whiskey drink be made in the "old-fashioned" way.</p><p>The Old Fashioned continued to evolve throughout the 20th century, with variations including the addition of fruit garnishes such as oranges and cherries, and sometimes even soda water. However, the essence of the Old Fashioned remained the same: whiskey, sugar, bitters, and a simple garnish.</p><h3>Introducing Kilian Old Fashioned</h3><p>Kilian Old Fashioned takes the foundational elements of the classic cocktail and elevates them to an entirely new level. The Kilian brand, known for its luxury perfumes, entered the world of spirits to offer a refined experience for those who seek the ultimate in quality and craftsmanship. By applying the same principles of luxury and attention to detail found in their fragrances, Kilian has crafted a cocktail that embodies sophistication and indulgence.</p><p>Kilian Old Fashioned stands out not only because of its exquisite ingredients but also its method of preparation. This is not just a drink—it's an experience that caters to the senses. Let’s explore what makes this cocktail truly exceptional.</p><h3>The Ingredients Behind Kilian Old Fashioned</h3><p>The ingredients used in Kilian Old Fashioned are crucial to understanding its appeal. This luxurious version of the Old Fashioned is made with premium spirits, carefully selected to create a harmonious and complex flavor profile.</p><ol><li><p><strong>Kilian’s Special Bourbon</strong><br>The backbone of the Kilian Old Fashioned is a premium bourbon. Kilian selects a high-quality, small-batch bourbon that is known for its deep, rich flavor with notes of vanilla, caramel, and oak. This carefully chosen bourbon provides the drink with the strong, smooth base that is a hallmark of any great Old Fashioned.</p></li><li><p><strong>Bitters</strong><br>Bitters are an essential component of the Old Fashioned, and Kilian Old Fashioned doesn’t skimp on this ingredient. A blend of aromatic bitters is used to bring depth and balance to the drink, enhancing the bourbon’s natural flavors. The bitterness also adds a layer of complexity, which sets this version apart from other variations.</p></li><li><p><strong>Citrus Peel</strong><br>While many Old Fashioned recipes feature a cherry or orange slice as garnish, Kilian Old Fashioned uses a carefully crafted citrus peel, typically orange, to add a fragrant aromatic element. The peel is often twisted and expressed over the glass to release its oils, adding an additional layer of fragrance and flavor.</p></li><li><p><strong>Luxurious Sweetener</strong><br>Rather than using simple syrup or regular sugar, Kilian Old Fashioned employs a carefully selected sweetener, often in the form of a high-end, natural sugar. This enhances the smoothness of the drink and offers a sophisticated sweetness without overpowering the spirit.</p></li></ol><h3>The Craftsmanship of Kilian Old Fashioned</h3><p>What truly sets Kilian Old Fashioned apart is the meticulous craftsmanship involved in its creation. The Kilian brand is known for its precision in blending and quality control, and they apply the same care to their cocktails. Kilian’s Old Fashioned is typically prepared by expert mixologists who understand the balance required to create the perfect cocktail. From the selection of ingredients to the final presentation, everything is considered to provide the consumer with the most luxurious experience.</p><p>The drink is served in a classic Old Fashioned glass, often with a large, single ice cube. This not only allows for gradual dilution but also maintains the drink’s coolness without overwhelming its flavors. In true Kilian style, the cocktail is presented beautifully, enhancing the visual and sensory experience.</p><h2>Why Choose Kilian Old Fashioned?</h2><p>Kilian Old Fashioned isn’t just a drink; it’s an experience.
